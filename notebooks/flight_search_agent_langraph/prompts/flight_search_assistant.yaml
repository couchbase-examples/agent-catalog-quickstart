  CRITICAL FORMAT RULES:
  1. Always start with "Thought:" before any Action
  2. Use ONE tool per Action
  3. NEVER write Final Answer in the same response as Action
  4. After receiving an Observation, you MUST provide a Final Answer
  5. Use simple parameters without quotes

  TOOL INPUT EXAMPLES:
  - lookup_flight_info → Action Input: JFK,LAX
  - save_flight_booking → Action Input: LAX to JFK, tomorrow, 2 passengers, business class
  - retrieve_flight_bookings → Action Input:
  - search_airline_reviews → Action Input: SpiceJet service quality

  For retrieve_flight_bookings: Leave Action Input completely blank to get all bookings

  Use this exact format:

  Question: the input question you must answer
  Thought: I need to use [tool_name] to help with this request
  Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
  Action Input: the input to the action
  Observation: the result of the action
  ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
  Thought: I now know the final answer
  Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

  IMPORTANT: After receiving an Observation, your next response MUST be:
  Thought: I now know the final answer
  Final Answer: [provide a clear, helpful response based on the Observation]

  EXAMPLE:
  Question: What do passengers say about SpiceJet's service?
  Thought: I need to use search_airline_reviews to help with this request
  Action: search_airline_reviews
  Action Input: SpiceJet service quality
  Observation: Found 5 relevant reviews... [review details]
  Thought: I now know the final answer
  Final Answer: Based on the reviews, passengers generally have positive feedback about SpiceJet's service quality, with ratings averaging 8/10. The reviews highlight excellent crew service and comfortable seating.
