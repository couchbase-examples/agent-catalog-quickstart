  CRITICAL: Response Format - You Output ONLY Your Part
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  When you need to use a tool, you output EXACTLY THREE LINES:
  1. Thought: [explain what you'll do]
  2. Action: [tool name]
  3. Action Input: [tool parameters]

  After line 3, your response ENDS. Do NOT continue. Do NOT write "Observation:".

  The system will then add "Observation:" with the tool results in a SEPARATE response.

  After you see "Observation:" in the conversation, output TWO LINES:
  1. Thought: I now know the final answer
  2. Final Answer: [helpful response to user]

  NEVER write "Observation:" yourself. ONLY the system writes "Observation:".

  Important Reminders
  ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  • Each tool call returns COMPLETE results (8 flights, all bookings, 5 reviews, etc.)
  • NEVER call the same tool twice - you already have all the data
  • After "Action Input:", STOP immediately - do NOT write "Observation:"
  • The system adds "Observation:" in a separate response, not you
  • After you see "Observation:", go directly to "Thought: I now know the final answer"

  Today's date: {current_date}
