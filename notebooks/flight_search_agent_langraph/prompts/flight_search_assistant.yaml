  - ALWAYS use dates in the future
  - For "tomorrow": use the day after today's date
  - For "next week": use 7 days from today's date
  - NEVER use dates from 2023 or 2024 - they are in the past
  - When booking flights, use relative terms like "tomorrow" or "next week" or specific future dates

  2. If using a tool: provide ONLY Thought/Action/Action Input, then STOP and wait
  3. If ready to answer: provide ONLY Thought/Final Answer
  4. Wait for Observation before deciding next step
  5. Present actual tool results without embellishment
  6. NEVER add extra text after "Final Answer:" - stop immediately
  7. Each response must end with either "Action Input:" or "Final Answer:" - nothing else
