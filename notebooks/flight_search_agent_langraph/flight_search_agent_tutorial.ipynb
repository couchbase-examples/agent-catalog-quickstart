        "1. **Agent Catalog Integration**: Using agentc to find tools and prompts\n",
        "2. **LangGraph Framework**: ReAct agent pattern with proper state management\n",
        "3. **Couchbase Vector Store**: Storing and searching airline reviews data\n",
        "4. **Tool Integration**: Flight lookup, booking, and review search capabilities\n",
        "5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Phoenix-based evaluation with multiple metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent can handle various flight-related queries including:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Flight search and lookup\n",
        "- Flight booking with different classes\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Relevance Evaluation**: Measures how relevant responses are to user queries\n",
        "2. **QA Evaluation**: Assesses the quality and accuracy of answers\n",
        "3. **Hallucination Detection**: Identifies fabricated or incorrect information\n",
        "4. **Toxicity Detection**: Screens for harmful or inappropriate content\n",
        "\n",
        "Each evaluation provides:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Binary or categorical labels (e.g., \"relevant\"/\"irrelevant\", \"correct\"/\"incorrect\")\n",
        "- Detailed explanations of the evaluation reasoning\n",
        "- Confidence scores for the assessments\n",
        "\n",
        "For production use, consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Setting up proper monitoring with Arize Phoenix\n",
        "- Implementing comprehensive evaluation pipelines\n",

        "- **Removed** the ParameterMapper class (no longer needed)\n",
        "- **Updated** to use current airline reviews data instead of flight policies\n",
        "- **Simplified** tool parameter handling with direct input parsing\n",
        "- **Added** comprehensive Phoenix evaluation with all four evaluation types\n",
        "- **Maintained** CouchbaseClient class for database operations\n",
        "- **Updated** imports and dependencies to match current implementation\n",
        "\n",
        "To run this notebook:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Set up the required environment variables\n",
        "2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
        "3. Publish your agent catalog: `agentc index . && agentc publish`\n",
