        "1. **Relevance Evaluation**: Measures how relevant responses are to user queries\n",
        "2. **QA Evaluation**: Assesses the quality and accuracy of answers\n",

        "- **Added** comprehensive Phoenix evaluation with all four evaluation types\n",
        "- **Maintained** CouchbaseClient class for database operations\n",
