2025-08-06 00:18:18,174 - __main__ - INFO - 💭 FULL REASONING:
2025-08-06 00:18:18,174 - __main__ - INFO - The question is about booking a flight from LAX to JFK for tomorrow, for 2 passengers in business class. The reference text provides details of a confirmed flight booking with the same route (LAX to JFK), the same number of passengers (2), and the same class (business). However, the departure date in the reference text is 2025-08-06, which does not match the 'tomorrow' requirement of the question. Despite this mismatch in the date, the reference text contains relevant information about a flight booking that matches other aspects of the question, such as the route, number of passengers, and class. Therefore, the reference text is relevant to the question as it provides a similar booking scenario, even though the date is incorrect.
