2025-08-05 12:32:16,126 - __main__ - INFO - To determine if the answer is correct, we need to evaluate whether the answer provides the information requested in the question. The question asks for flights from JFK to LAX. The reference text provides a list of available flights from JFK to LAX, including the airlines and aircraft types. 

The answer, however, does not provide any information about the flights. Instead, it contains a message indicating that the agent stopped due to an iteration limit or time limit, and it does not include any search results or details about the flights. 

Since the answer does not provide the requested information about flights from JFK to LAX, it does not correctly answer the question based on the reference text.

2025-08-05 12:32:16,127 - __main__ - INFO - To determine if the answer is correct, we need to compare the information in the answer with the reference text and the question.

1. **Question Analysis**: The question asks to book an economy flight from JFK to MIA for next week for 1 passenger.

2. **Reference Text Analysis**: The reference text confirms that a flight booking from JFK to MIA has been successfully processed with the following details:
   - Route: JFK to MIA
   - Date: Next week
   - Passengers: 1
   - Class: Economy
   - Status: Confirmed

3. **Answer Analysis**: The answer provided does not contain any information about the booking being processed or confirmed. Instead, it includes a message indicating that the agent stopped due to an iteration limit or time limit, and there are no search results or confirmation details provided.

4. **Comparison**: The reference text confirms the booking, but the answer does not provide any confirmation or details about the booking. The answer only includes a message about an agent stopping, which does not address the question or confirm the booking.

Since the answer does not provide the necessary confirmation or details that the booking was successfully made, it does not correctly answer the question based on the reference text.
