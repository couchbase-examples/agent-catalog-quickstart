2025-08-06 00:05:55,460 - __main__ - INFO - The question is about booking a flight from LAX to JFK for tomorrow, for 2 passengers in business class. The reference text provides details of a flight booking confirmation with the same route (LAX to JFK), the same number of passengers (2), and the same class (business). However, the departure date in the reference text is 2025-08-06, which does not match 'tomorrow' as specified in the question. Despite this discrepancy in the date, the reference text contains relevant information about a similar booking, including the route, number of passengers, and class, which are all directly related to the question. Therefore, the reference text is relevant to the question as it provides a similar booking scenario, even though the date does not match exactly.
