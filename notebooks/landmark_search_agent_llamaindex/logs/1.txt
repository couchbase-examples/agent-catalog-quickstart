   📝 Description: One of Paris's best kept secrets, painted by Monet numerous times. It is a very elegant centre of green in the middle of cosmopolitan Paris. Make sure you check out the statues, entrance rotunda and the surrounding mansions. Thanks to Haussmann himself this precious slice of parkland was reserved for the enjoyment and leisure of the people of Paris. It is unusual in France due to its casual, informal &quot;English&quot; style planning, and is a contrast to other Parisian parks such as the classically laid out and formal Luxemburg Gardens and the Tuileries. Randomly placed throughout the park are scaled-down architectural replicas including an Egyptian pyramid, Dutch windmill, and a Chinese fort. Free Wi-Fi in the park..

Answer: Monet's House, also known as the Fondation Claude Monet, is located in Giverny, France. It is a house museum that showcases the life and work of the famous Impressionist painter Claude Monet. The house is a quiet and eccentric place with an Orient-influenced style, and it includes Monet's collection of Japanese prints. However, the real drawcard of the house is the beautiful gardens around it, which feature a water garden with a Japanese bridge, weeping willows, and waterlilies. The gardens are now iconic and a must-see for anyone visiting the house.
