Answer: The search results show several restaurants serving Asian cuisine, including 101 Coffee Shop in Hollywood, Los Angeles, and 21st Amendment in San Francisco, SoMa. However, it seems that none of the top results are specifically Asian restaurants. It's possible that the search results are not accurate or that the query was not specific enough. If you're looking for Asian restaurants, I recommend trying a more specific search query or checking online review sites such as Yelp for recommendations.

They serve cheap drinks and the patrons range from surly full time alcoholics, to friendlier neighborhood personalities... but hey, that's the 'Loin!.
