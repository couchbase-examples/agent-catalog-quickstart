Answer: The search results show several restaurants serving Asian cuisine, including San Francisco/The Avenues, Paris/7th arrondissement, Hollywood, Bunessan, and San Francisco/SoMa. However, it seems that none of these restaurants are specifically serving Asian cuisine. The description of San Francisco/The Avenues mentions that it has an inexpensive selection of fresh fruits and vegetables, but it does not mention Asian cuisine. The description of Paris/7th arrondissement mentions that it has a restaurant with a view of the Eiffel Tower, but it does not mention Asian cuisine. The description of Hollywood mentions that it has a coffee shop with a great selection of sandwiches and burgers, but it does not mention Asian cuisine. The description of Bunessan mentions that it has a hotel with a restaurant that serves fresh food at reasonable prices, but it does not mention Asian cuisine. The description of San Francisco/SoMa mentions that it has a brew pub with a great selection of beers and classic brew pub-grub, but it does not mention Asian cuisine. Therefore, I would recommend searching for other restaurants that specifically serve Asian cuisine.
