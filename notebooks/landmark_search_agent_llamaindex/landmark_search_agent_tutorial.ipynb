            "Answer: The most famous Monet's House is located in Giverny, France, and it is a museum showcasing the life and work of the famous artist Claude Monet. The house is a quiet and eccentric Orient-influenced style, and it includes Monet's collection of Japanese prints. However, the real drawcard is the beautiful gardens around the house, which feature a water garden with a Japanese bridge, weeping willows, and waterlilies. The gardens are now iconic and a must-see for any art lover or nature enthusiast.\n",

        "1. **Function Definition Order** - Data loading functions now defined before use\n",
        "2. **Missing Lenient Templates** - `LENIENT_QA_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` and `LENIENT_HALLUCINATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` now properly defined\n",
        "3. **Variable Definition Order** - All variables defined before use\n",
        "4. **Import Typos** - Fixed `LEVANCY_PROMPT_RAILS_MAP` → `RAG_RELEVANCY_PROMPT_RAILS_MAP`\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🏗️ **COMPLETE ARCHITECTURE:**\n",
        "- **Agent Catalog Integration** - Tools and prompts from agentc\n",
        "- **LlamaIndex Framework** - ReAct agent pattern with semantic search\n",
        "- **Couchbase Vector Store** - travel-sample landmark data\n",
        "- **Priority 1 AI Services** - Capella AI + OpenAI fallbacks\n",
        "- **Phoenix Evaluation** - Lenient templates for dynamic data\n",
        "- **Self-contained Structure** - All functions properly ordered\n",

        "3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
