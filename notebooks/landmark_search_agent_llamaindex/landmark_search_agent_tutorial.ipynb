The gardens feature a water garden with a Japanese bridge, weeping willows, and water lilies, which are now iconic symbols of Monet's work. The house itself is a unique and interesting example of Oriental-influenced architecture, and it includes Monet's collection of Japanese prints.

        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a complete landmark search agent implementation using:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Agent Catalog Integration**: Using agentc to find tools and prompts\n",
        "2. **LlamaIndex Framework**: ReAct agent pattern with semantic search capabilities\n",
        "3. **Couchbase Vector Store**: Storing and searching landmark data from travel-sample bucket\n",
        "4. **NVIDIA NIMs + Capella AI**: NVIDIA NIMs for LLM, Capella AI for embeddings\n",
        "5. **Single Tool Architecture**: Focused on `search_landmarks` for landmark discovery\n",
        "6. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Phoenix-based evaluation with LlamaIndex instrumentation\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent can handle various landmark-related queries including:\n",
        "- Landmark search by location (Tokyo, London, Paris)\n",
        "- Finding specific types of attractions (museums, parks, monuments)\n",
        "- Cultural and historical site discovery\n",
        "- Tourist attraction recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Phoenix Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook demonstrates all four key Phoenix evaluation types:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Relevance Evaluation**: Measures how relevant responses are to landmark queries\n",
        "2. **QA Evaluation**: Assesses the quality and accuracy of landmark information\n",
        "3. **Hallucination Detection**: Identifies fabricated or incorrect landmark information\n",
        "4. **Toxicity Detection**: Screens for harmful or inappropriate content\n",
        "\n",
        "Each evaluation provides:\n",
        "- Binary or categorical labels (e.g., \"relevant\"/\"irrelevant\", \"correct\"/\"incorrect\")\n",
        "- Detailed explanations of the evaluation reasoning\n",
        "- Confidence scores for the assessments\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "This landmark search agent implementation:\n",
        "- **Uses LlamaIndex**: Advanced RAG framework with ReAct agent pattern\n",
        "- **Uses travel-sample bucket**: Leverages existing Couchbase landmark data\n",
        "- **NVIDIA NIMs integration**: High-performance LLM inference\n",
        "- **Capella AI embeddings**: High-quality vector embeddings for semantic search\n",
        "- **OpenAI fallback**: Graceful fallback when Capella AI is unavailable\n",
        "- **Single focused tool**: Simplified architecture with one search tool\n",
        "- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Full Phoenix evaluation pipeline\n",
        "- **LlamaIndex instrumentation**: Integrated observability and tracing\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Source\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent uses landmark data from the `travel-sample.inventory.landmark` collection, which contains:\n",
        "- Real landmark information with names, locations, and descriptions\n",
        "- Structured data with address, city, country, and type information\n",
        "- Rich text descriptions suitable for vector embedding\n",
        "- Global coverage of tourist attractions and points of interest\n",
        "\n",
        "## Architecture Differences\n",
        "\n",
        "This landmark search agent differs from the other agents:\n",
        "- **LlamaIndex** (not LangChain or LangGraph) - advanced RAG framework\n",
        "- **NVIDIA NIMs LLM**: High-performance inference instead of OpenAI/Capella LLM\n",
        "- **ReAct Pattern**: Built-in reasoning and action capabilities\n",
        "- **Landmark-specific**: Optimized for tourism and travel use cases\n",
        "- **Global Settings**: Uses LlamaIndex global settings for LLM and embeddings\n",
        "\n",
        "For production use, consider:\n",
        "- Setting up proper monitoring with Arize Phoenix\n",
        "- Implementing comprehensive evaluation pipelines\n",
        "- Adding error handling and retry logic\n",
        "- Scaling the vector store for larger datasets\n",
        "- Adding more sophisticated query understanding\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "To run this notebook:\n",
        "1. Set up the required environment variables (Couchbase connection, API keys)\n",
        "2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
        "3. Ensure travel-sample bucket is available in your Couchbase cluster\n",
        "4. Publish your agent catalog: `agentc index . && agentc publish`\n",
        "5. Run the notebook cells sequentially\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent will automatically load landmark data from travel-sample and create embeddings for semantic search capabilities. NVIDIA API key is required for LLM functionality.\n"
