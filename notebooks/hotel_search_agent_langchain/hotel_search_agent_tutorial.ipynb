        "- **Priority 2 AI Services**: Custom Capella classes with direct API keys (tested and working)\n",
        "- **SSL Fixes**: Automatic addition of `?tls_verify=none` for Capella clusters\n",
        "- **Token Configuration**: Environment variable `CAPELLA_API_EMBEDDING_MAX_TOKENS` support\n",
        "- **Complete Hotel Data**: Full implementation of travel-sample hotel data loading\n",
        "- **Agent Catalog Integration**: Tools and prompts loaded from indexed catalog\n",
        "- **Phoenix Evaluation**: Comprehensive evaluation with lenient hotel-specific templates\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔧 **Key Features:**\n",
        "- **Self-Contained**: All code included inline - no external file dependencies\n",
        "- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and fallback systems\n",
        "- **Real Data**: Uses actual travel-sample.inventory.hotel collection\n",
        "- **Configurable**: Environment variables for all settings\n",
        "- **Production Ready**: Includes logging, monitoring, and evaluation\n",

        "- Agent Catalog indexed: `agentc index tools/` and `agentc index prompts/`\n",
        "- Optional: Phoenix evaluation dependencies\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 **Usage:**\n",
        "1. Configure environment variables in `.env` file\n",
        "2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
        "3. Index Agent Catalog: `agentc index . && agentc publish`\n",
