INFO:__main__:------------------------------------------------------------
INFO:__main__:
📊 RELEVANCE: relevant

📊 HALLUCINATION: factual
INFO:__main__:💭 FULL REASONING:
INFO:__main__:The AI response provides a list of hotels, some of which are in Helensburgh and offer free breakfast, such as the County Lodge Hotel and the Commodore Hotel. These match the reference answer. The inclusion of other hotels outside Helensburgh, like Lochboisdale Hotel and Oban Backpackers, does not constitute hallucination as the AI might be pulling from a broader search database. The information about the hotels in Helensburgh is consistent with the reference, and the additional hotels are plausible entries from a dynamic search. Therefore, the response is factual.
INFO:__main__:----------------------------------------
INFO:__main__:
