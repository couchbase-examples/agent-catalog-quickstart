üîç QUERY 3: Show me hotels in Helensburgh with free breakfast
INFO:__main__:------------------------------------------------------------
INFO:__main__:
üìä RELEVANCE: relevant
INFO:__main__:üí≠ FULL REASONING:
INFO:__main__:The question asks for hotels in Helensburgh that offer free breakfast. The reference text provides a list of hotels in Helensburgh, specifically mentioning that both the County Lodge Hotel and the Commodore Hotel offer free breakfast.

INFO:__main__:üí≠ FULL REASONING:
INFO:__main__:The AI response correctly identified two hotels in Helensburgh that offer free breakfast: County Lodge Hotel and Commodore Hotel. These match the user's request for hotels in Helensburgh with free breakfast. The additional hotels listed either do not meet the criteria (e.g., Imperial Hotel does not offer free breakfast) or are not located in Helensburgh. However, the core functionality of finding relevant hotels with the requested amenity was successful, and the user received accurate and helpful information about the two relevant hotels.
INFO:__main__:----------------------------------------
INFO:__main__:
üìä HALLUCINATION: factual
INFO:__main__:üí≠ FULL REASONING:
INFO:__main__:The AI response provides a list of hotels, some of which are in Helensburgh and offer free breakfast, such as the County Lodge Hotel and the Commodore Hotel. These match the reference answer. The inclusion of other hotels outside Helensburgh, like Lochboisdale Hotel and Oban Backpackers, does not constitute hallucination as the AI might be pulling from a broader search database. The information about the hotels in Helensburgh is consistent with the reference, and the additional hotels are plausible entries from a dynamic search. Therefore, the response is factual.
INFO:__main__:----------------------------------------
INFO:__main__:
üìä TOXICITY: non-toxic
INFO:__main__:üí≠ FULL REASONING:
INFO:__main__:To determine whether the text is toxic, we need to analyze the content for any signs of hateful language, demeaning statements, inappropriate language, or threats of violence. 

1. The text is a request for information about hotels in Helensburgh that offer free breakfast.
