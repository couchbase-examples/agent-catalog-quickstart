        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a complete hotel support agent implementation using:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Agent Catalog Integration**: Using agentc to find tools and prompts\n",
        "2. **LangChain Framework**: ReAct agent pattern with Agent Catalog callbacks\n",
        "3. **Couchbase Vector Store**: Storing and searching hotel data from travel-sample bucket\n",
        "4. **Single Tool Architecture**: Focused on `search_vector_database` for hotel search\n",
        "5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Phoenix-based evaluation with multiple metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent can handle various hotel-related queries including:\n",
        "- Hotel search by location and amenities\n",
        "- Finding hotels with specific features (parking, internet, spa, etc.)\n",
        "- Luxury hotel searches with premium amenities\n",
        "- Location-based hotel recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Phoenix Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook demonstrates all four key Phoenix evaluation types:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Relevance Evaluation**: Measures how relevant responses are to user queries\n",
        "2. **QA Evaluation**: Assesses the quality and accuracy of answers\n",
        "3. **Hallucination Detection**: Identifies fabricated or incorrect information\n",
        "4. **Toxicity Detection**: Screens for harmful or inappropriate content\n",
        "\n",
        "Each evaluation provides:\n",
        "- Binary or categorical labels (e.g., \"relevant\"/\"irrelevant\", \"correct\"/\"incorrect\")\n",
        "- Detailed explanations of the evaluation reasoning\n",
        "- Confidence scores for the assessments\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "This hotel support agent implementation:\n",
        "- **Uses travel-sample bucket**: Leverages existing Couchbase sample data\n",
        "- **Capella AI integration**: Supports both embeddings and LLM through Capella AI\n",
        "- **Fallback to OpenAI**: Graceful fallback when Capella AI is unavailable\n",
        "- **Single focused tool**: Simplified architecture with one search tool\n",
        "- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Full Phoenix evaluation pipeline\n",
        "- **Agent Catalog callbacks**: Integrated observability and tracing\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Source\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent uses hotel data from the `travel-sample.inventory.hotel` collection, which contains:\n",
        "- Real hotel information with names, locations, and amenities\n",
        "- Structured data with address, city, country, and facilities\n",
        "- Rich text descriptions suitable for vector embedding\n",
        "- Comprehensive coverage of global hotel properties\n",
        "\n",
        "For production use, consider:\n",
        "- Setting up proper monitoring with Arize Phoenix\n",
        "- Implementing comprehensive evaluation pipelines\n",
        "- Adding error handling and retry logic\n",
        "- Scaling the vector store for larger datasets\n",
        "- Adding more sophisticated query understanding\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "To run this notebook:\n",
        "1. Set up the required environment variables (Couchbase connection, API keys)\n",
        "2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
        "3. Ensure travel-sample bucket is available in your Couchbase cluster\n",
