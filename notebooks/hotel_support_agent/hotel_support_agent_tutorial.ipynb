            "2025-07-23 15:30:21,900 - __main__ - INFO -    Explanation: The query asks for a hotel in London with free internet access. The reference text is supposed to provide specific hotel information and amenities, but it does not contain any specific details about hotels in London or their amenities. The answer provides specific information about a hotel, Chelsea House Hotel, including its location, free breakfast, and internet access. However, since the reference text does not provide any specific hotel information, the details in the answer cannot be verified against the reference text. Therefore, the answer is considered a hallucination because it includes specific details that are not supported by the reference text.\n",

        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a complete hotel support agent implementation using:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Agent Catalog Integration**: Using agentc to find tools and prompts\n",
        "2. **LangChain Framework**: ReAct agent pattern with Agent Catalog callbacks\n",
        "3. **Couchbase Vector Store**: Storing and searching hotel data from travel-sample bucket\n",
        "4. **Single Tool Architecture**: Focused on `search_vector_database` for hotel search\n",
        "5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Phoenix-based evaluation with multiple metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent can handle various hotel-related queries including:\n",
        "- Hotel search by location and amenities\n",
        "- Finding hotels with specific features (parking, internet, spa, etc.)\n",
        "- Luxury hotel searches with premium amenities\n",
        "- Location-based hotel recommendations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Phoenix Evaluation Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook demonstrates all four key Phoenix evaluation types:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Relevance Evaluation**: Measures how relevant responses are to user queries\n",
        "2. **QA Evaluation**: Assesses the quality and accuracy of answers\n",
        "3. **Hallucination Detection**: Identifies fabricated or incorrect information\n",
        "4. **Toxicity Detection**: Screens for harmful or inappropriate content\n",
        "\n",
        "Each evaluation provides:\n",
        "- Binary or categorical labels (e.g., \"relevant\"/\"irrelevant\", \"correct\"/\"incorrect\")\n",
        "- Detailed explanations of the evaluation reasoning\n",
        "- Confidence scores for the assessments\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Features\n",
        "\n",
        "This hotel support agent implementation:\n",
        "- **Uses travel-sample bucket**: Leverages existing Couchbase sample data\n",
        "- **Capella AI integration**: Supports both embeddings and LLM through Capella AI\n",
        "- **Fallback to OpenAI**: Graceful fallback when Capella AI is unavailable\n",
        "- **Single focused tool**: Simplified architecture with one search tool\n",
        "- **Comprehensive evaluation**: Full Phoenix evaluation pipeline\n",
        "- **Agent Catalog callbacks**: Integrated observability and tracing\n",
        "\n",
        "## Data Source\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent uses hotel data from the `travel-sample.inventory.hotel` collection, which contains:\n",
        "- Real hotel information with names, locations, and amenities\n",
        "- Structured data with address, city, country, and facilities\n",
        "- Rich text descriptions suitable for vector embedding\n",
        "- Comprehensive coverage of global hotel properties\n",
        "\n",
        "For production use, consider:\n",
        "- Setting up proper monitoring with Arize Phoenix\n",
        "- Implementing comprehensive evaluation pipelines\n",
        "- Adding error handling and retry logic\n",
        "- Scaling the vector store for larger datasets\n",
        "- Adding more sophisticated query understanding\n",
        "\n",
        "## Usage Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "To run this notebook:\n",
        "1. Set up the required environment variables (Couchbase connection, API keys)\n",
        "2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
        "3. Ensure travel-sample bucket is available in your Couchbase cluster\n",
        "4. Publish your agent catalog: `agentc index . && agentc publish`\n",
        "5. Run the notebook cells sequentially\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent will automatically load hotel data from travel-sample and create embeddings for semantic search capabilities.\n"
