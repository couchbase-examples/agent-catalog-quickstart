Reproduction
from langchain.chat_models import AzureChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_pandas_dataframe_agent
from langchain.agents import create_csv_agent
import os
import openai

os.environ[‚ÄúOPENAI_API_BASE‚Äù] = os.environ[‚ÄúAZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT‚Äù] = AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
os.environ[‚ÄúOPENAI_API_KEY‚Äù] = os.environ[‚ÄúAZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY‚Äù] = AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
os.environ[‚ÄúOPENAI_API_VERSION‚Äù] = os.environ[‚ÄúAZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION‚Äù] = AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION
os.environ[‚ÄúOPENAI_API_TYPE‚Äù] = ‚Äúazure‚Äù

df=pd.read_csv(‚Äòdata.csv‚Äô).fillna(value = 0)

llm = AzureChatOpenAI(deployment_name=‚Äúgpt-35-turbo‚Äù, model_name=‚Äúgpt-35-turbo‚Äù,temperature=0)
agent_executor = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(llm=llm,df=df,verbose=True)

response = agent_executor.run(prompt + QUESTION)
print(response)

Expected behavior
The current execution of agent results in errors like "Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit" and "Couldn't parse LLM output".
Also noticed that agent runs gets into multiple loops in identifying the valid tool but fails to identify tool , says as not valid tool and tries another one and ultimately stops with iteration limit or time limit.

Kindly suggest me on advice/suggestions to resolve the same.
Is there any particular tabular data structure that langchain works best with?
Do I need to add any particular kind of tool (As observed it tries multiple tools and says not valid tool)
Any modifications I need to make with the code?

Answer
To resolve the "Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit" error, you can increase the max_iterations and/or max_execution_time parameters when calling the AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools() function. This will allow the agent to run for more iterations or for a longer time before stopping.

For the "Couldn't parse LLM output" error, it might be caused by an issue with the prompt or the language model's output. You can try adjusting the prefix, suffix, and input_variables parameters when calling the _get_prompt_and_tools() function to create a more suitable prompt for the language model

Regarding specific data structures or tools that work best with LangChain, it is designed to work with pandas DataFrames. The _get_prompt_and_tools() function and the PythonAstREPLTool are used to create prompts and tools that work with DataFrames

Hi, @Rajlakshmi0187! I'm Dosu, and I'm here to help the LangChain team manage their backlog. I wanted to let you know that we are marking this issue as stale.

Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue you reported is related to the agent executor stopping due to iteration or time limits, resulting in errors and multiple loops in identifying valid tools. Devstein suggested increasing the max_iterations and/or max_execution_time parameters when calling the AgentExecutor.from_agent_and_tools() function to resolve the error. They also recommended adjusting the prompt and input variables to create a more suitable prompt for the language model. It's worth noting that the LangChain repository is designed to work with pandas DataFrames.

Before we close this issue, we wanted to check with you if it is still relevant to the latest version of the LangChain repository. If it is, please let us know by commenting on the issue. Otherwise, feel free to close the issue yourself, or it will be automatically closed in 7 days.

Thank you for your contribution to the LangChain repository!

But where we have to set these arguments and what are its standard or ideal values.

if max_iter = 10 , e.g. does that mean there will be 10 api calls , bascially i have set the max_iter to 1 , so that there is only one api call. but i get this error: Agent Executor stops due to iteration limit or time limit
