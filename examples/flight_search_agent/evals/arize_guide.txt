‚è∫ Perfect! I have successfully implemented Arize AI for evaluations alongside the existing Ragas framework. Here's a comprehensive summary of what has been
  completed:

  ‚úÖ Implementation Summary

  1. Flight Search Agent - Arize Implementation

  - File: /examples/flight_search_agent/evals/eval_short.py
  - Features: Complete Arize AI evaluation system with observability, LLM-as-judge scoring, and comprehensive scenario testing
  - Dependencies: Already included in pyproject.toml

  2. Multi-Agent LangGraph - Arize Integration

  - File: /agent-catalog/examples/with_langgraph/evals/eval_arize.py
  - Features: Comparative evaluation between Ragas and Arize frameworks
  - Dependencies: Added to pyproject.toml analysis group

  3. Unified Evaluation Runner

  - File: /run_evaluations.py
  - Features: Centralized script to run evaluations across both projects with any framework

  4. Comprehensive Documentation

  - File: /EVALUATION_FRAMEWORKS_COMPARISON.md
  - Content: Detailed comparison of Ragas vs Arize architectures, use cases, and integration approaches
  - Updated: Flight search agent README with Arize setup instructions

  üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Integration

  Ragas Framework:

  - Focus: Conversation quality evaluation with LLM-based similarity scoring
  - Best For: Development phase, dialogue quality assessment
  - Integration: Uses Agent Catalog spans for logging, conversation schema for evaluation

  Arize AI Framework:

  - Focus: Production observability with comprehensive LLM monitoring
  - Best For: Production deployment, performance optimization, A/B testing
  - Integration: OpenTelemetry instrumentation, trace visualization, experiment tracking

  Agent Catalog Integration:

  Both frameworks leverage:
  - Span-based logging for consistent observability
  - Tool and prompt management for unified agent behavior
  - State management patterns for evaluation consistency

  üìä Key Features Implemented

  Arize Capabilities:

  1. Real-time Observability: Full request tracing and performance monitoring
  2. LLM-as-Judge Evaluation: Automated relevance and correctness scoring
  3. Experiment Tracking: A/B testing and configuration comparison
  4. Production Analytics: Cost tracking, latency analysis, error monitoring
  5. Multi-Agent Workflow Tracing: Visualization of agent transitions

  Evaluation Scenarios:

  - Basic Queries: Simple flight searches
  - Complex Queries: Multi-leg routing with constraints
  - Policy Queries: Flight guidelines and regulations
  - Booking Operations: Reservation management
  - Irrelevant Queries: Non-flight inputs (should be rejected)

  Comparative Analysis:

  - Side-by-side evaluation using both Ragas and Arize
  - Framework performance comparison
  - Unified reporting with metrics from both systems

  üöÄ Usage Instructions

  Quick Start:

  # Install dependencies
  pip install arize-phoenix[evals] arize-otel openinference-instrumentation-langchain

  # Set environment variables
  export ARIZE_SPACE_ID="your-space-id"
  export ARIZE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
  export ARIZE_DEVELOPER_KEY="your-developer-key"

  # Run unified evaluations
  python run_evaluations.py --project both --framework both --comparison

  Individual Framework Testing:

  # Arize evaluation for flight search agent
  cd examples/flight_search_agent
  python evals/eval_short.py comprehensive

  # Ragas evaluation for multi-agent system
  cd agent-catalog/examples/with_langgraph
  python -m pytest evals/eval_short.py -v

  # Arize evaluation for multi-agent system
  python evals/eval_arize.py comprehensive

  üìà Benefits Achieved

  1. Comprehensive Evaluation Strategy: Development with Ragas + Production with Arize
  2. Framework Comparison: Direct evaluation of different scoring methodologies
  3. Production Readiness: Real-time monitoring and optimization capabilities
  4. Unified Workflow: Single command to run evaluations across all projects
  5. Educational Value: Clear demonstration of different evaluation approaches

  The implementation provides a complete evaluation ecosystem that supports both development iteration and production deployment, with detailed documentation
  for understanding the architectural differences and choosing the right framework for specific use cases.
