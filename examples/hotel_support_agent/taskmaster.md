  - [x] Technical implementation details
  - [x] Testing and validation guidelines
  - [x] Deployment considerations

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **User Query** → Hotel search request with preferences
2. **Agent Processing** → LangGraph agent analyzes query and selects tools
3. **Vector Search** → Couchbase semantic search for relevant hotels
4. **Detail Retrieval** → Comprehensive hotel information gathering
5. **Response Generation** → Professional recommendations with reasoning

### Key Components
- **Couchbase Vector Store**: Semantic search with 1536-dimension embeddings
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: text-embedding-3-small model for vector generation
- **LangGraph Agent**: Tool orchestration and conversation management
- **Agent Catalog**: Framework integration with proper decorators
- **Professional Tools**: Production-grade error handling and logging

### Hotel Data Model
- **Basic Information**: Name, location, description, rating
- **Pricing**: Price ranges and availability
- **Amenities**: Comprehensive facility listings
- **Policies**: Check-in/out times, cancellation terms
- **Contact**: Phone, email, address information

## Testing Guidelines

### Environment Setup Testing
- [ ] Verify Couchbase connection with provided credentials
- [ ] Test OpenAI API key integration
- [ ] Validate bucket, scope, and collection creation
- [ ] Confirm vector search index deployment

### Tool Functionality Testing  
- [ ] Test semantic search with various hotel queries
- [ ] Validate hotel detail retrieval for each sample hotel
- [ ] Verify error handling for invalid queries
- [ ] Test vector similarity scoring accuracy

### Agent Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete user interaction flow
- [ ] Validate tool selection and execution
- [ ] Verify response quality and professionalism
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure vector search response times
- [ ] Test concurrent user interactions
- [ ] Validate memory usage with large datasets
- [ ] Monitor Couchbase cluster performance

## Deployment Considerations

### Production Requirements
- **Couchbase Cluster**: Properly configured with vector search index
- **Environment Variables**: Secure credential management
- **Dependencies**: All Python packages installed via poetry
- **Monitoring**: Logging and error tracking implementation
- **Scaling**: Consider connection pooling for high usage

### Security Checklist
- [ ] API keys stored securely in environment variables
- [ ] Database credentials encrypted and managed
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Authentication and authorization for production use

## Success Criteria
- [x] Professional hotel search agent with no emojis/stickers
- [x] Real Couchbase vector search integration
- [x] Production-grade error handling without fallbacks
- [x] Comprehensive hotel recommendations with detailed information
- [x] Agent Catalog framework proper integration
