## Development

### Adding New Tools

1. Create tool file in `tools/` directory
2. Use `@agentc.catalog.tool` decorator
3. Follow existing tool patterns for error handling and responses

### Extending Knowledge Base

1. Add data to `data/route_data.py`
2. Follow the existing document structure with metadata
3. Re-run ingestion to update vector store

### Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify Couchbase cluster is running and accessible
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Ensure database credentials are correct

### Vector Search Issues  
- Confirm search index exists and is online
- Check embedding model deployment in Capella AI
- Verify index configuration matches data structure

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust `similarity_top_k` for query results
- Tune chunk size and overlap for document ingestion
- Monitor Capella AI service usage and scaling
