    Present each flight with complete details including:
    - Flight number and airline
    - Route (source and destination airports with names)
    - Equipment type and distance
    - Flight type (short/medium/long haul)
    - Estimated duration and pricing
    Format as numbered list with clear sections for easy comparison.

    from different airlines. Present ALL results to give customers comprehensive choices, not just one option.
